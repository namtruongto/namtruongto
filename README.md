# Hi 👋🏾 I'm Truong


I'm a full-stack software engineer focused on backend development. My skills encompass Java Springboot, Python|Django , Typescript, Javascript, Angular, and a range of other tools. This expertise enables me to develop solutions that seamlessly connect technology with business requirements.  In addition to coding, I hold a profound interest in business development, which significantly enriches my problem-solving approach.

In my journey,  I've had the privilege to develop specialized software solutions for businesses in my community. These solutions span across different industries, including healthcare, education, inventory, e-payments, management tools, etc.

Collaboration is something I truly value, and being part of a team knowing that the software I build is helping others by solving their problems gives me a great sense of satisfaction.
